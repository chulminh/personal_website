I routed a slot through the leg and skirt in order to put a floating tenon of sorts and in doing so, saw how terrible of a job I did with the joint. Next time, I'm definitely going to be taking my time with the mortise and tenons.",

I wanted to give up because all the tear out on the table-top was giving me a lot of greif. I'm giving this post a higher give-up rating because dealing with the constant tear-out made me truly want to throw all my tools into my neighbor's lawn.",
