<p>
  Pine work bench all done! I definitely restricted my design based on cost,
  which in hindsight I should have spent the extra few dollars to make a wider
  table. The work bench is too narrow to use properly :(. I'm going to go with
  my original plan (which was a bit more expensive) of making a Rob Cosman style
  work bench
