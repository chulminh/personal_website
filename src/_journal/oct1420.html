  Plywood and MDF workbench Done! It took a while to get done because I had to
  return my tools and buy different ones (table saw -> circular saw, corded
  router -> cordless router) and also because I had to figure out how to rip
  baords and cut to equal lengths, but I'm super happy with how sturdy and heavy
  this table came out. Was definitely stressful though hahaha
